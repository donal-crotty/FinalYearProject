# FinalYearProject
The purpose of my Final Year Project was to develop a responsive web application that would aid personnel working within the Fishing Industry 
whilst planning voyages and fishing trips.

This application visualized Tidal Wave Prediction Data to help the user decide what days would have the greatest potential of 
an increased catch and profit. 

This application, added with a Thesis with the title "What will be the most beneficial type of data visualization 
for a user to analyse tidal wave predictions in Ireland?" investigated this concept idea both practically and via research.

## This repo is a work in progress. I plan to refactor my Final Year Project in Angular to help me learn the framework. I will be updating this repo as I work.
